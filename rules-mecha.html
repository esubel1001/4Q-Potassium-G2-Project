                    <p>To play, the player must enter individual letters as guesses. If the guessed letter is in the word, it will be revealed in its correct position. However, if the letter is incorrect, the player loses one life. The game continues until the player correctly guesses the word or loses all their lives. Players can only input letters from A-Z, and repeated incorrect guesses will continue to reduce their remaining lives. If all lives are lost, the game is over. At the end of the game, the player has the option to restart or exit.</p>
                    <p>• The player starts with 5 lives.</p>
                    <p>• The game consists of three difficulty levels:</p>
                    <p>• Easy: 5-letter words</p>
                    <p>• Medium: 7-letter words</p>
                    <p>• Hard: 10-letter words</p>
                    <p>• Each round, the player must guess the word within a limited number of tries.</p>
                    <p>• If the player guesses correctly, they advance to the next round.</p> 
                    <p>• If the player fails to guess the word, they lose one life.</p>
                    <p>• The game continues until:</p> 
                    <p>• The player runs out of lives → Game Over</p>
                    <p>• The player chooses to exit</p>

                    <p>• Letter Reveal: If the guessed letter is in the word, it will be revealed in its correct position.</p>
                    <p>• Incorrect Guess Penalty: Each incorrect guess deducts one life.</p>
                    <p>• Winning Condition: The player must correctly guess the word before running out of lives.</p>
                    <p>• Game Over Condition: If all 5 lives are lost, the game ends.</p>

                <p>The player is given 5 lives, each round the player must guess the word and each round (easy medium hard) it gets harder like for easy 5 letters per word, for medium 7 letters per word, and for hard is 10 letters per word, if the player fails to guess the word the player loses or game over then either replay or exit the game.</p>
            <br>
                <p>The game begins with the player having five lives. The objective is to guess the correct word in each round before losing all lives. The game has three difficulty levels: Easy (5-letter words), Medium (7-letter words), and Hard (10-letter words). As the difficulty increases, the words become longer, making them harder to guess. In each round, the player must guess letters to reveal the hidden word. If the player correctly identifies all the letters before running out of lives, they proceed to the next word. However, if they fail to guess the word and lose all five lives, the game ends, and they can choose to either restart or exit.</p>
